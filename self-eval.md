# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

**Answer: It was pretty fun. I had to double check syntax repeatedly though!**

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

**Answer: I got through a series of rarefactions and compressions! I think a have a problem of getting too hyper-focused and I need to force myself to take breaks.**


- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

**Answer: next week? I'm guessing this should have been the 22nd. I have a nice 12 day break (from work as well) before I start mod 1, so I intend to charge my battery up and review what I've learned during mod 0 while possibly expanding upon it before mod 1 starts. If you could share any more exercises/challenges or resources that offer those (for our current level) to keep progressively challenging/building up our technical skills, that would be great!**
